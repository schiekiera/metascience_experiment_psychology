Several studies have documented positive effects of mindfulness-based interventions in the treatment of eating disorders, and systematic reviews have indicated emotion regulation as a specific mechanism of mindfulness-based interventions. Hence, we hypothesized that low emotion regulation skills in individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) might be improved by mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). A total of 129 women diagnosed with BN received group MBCT. The Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS) was applied pre- and post-intervention and an ANOVA was conducted. We did not find a significant interaction effect: The data revealed no improvement in emotion regulation over time in patients reporting lower emotion regulation skills at baseline.

In psychotherapeutic treatments of other disorders, it has been shown that women benefit more from CBT than do men in terms of long-term quality of life (QoL). This observational study examined whether women with OCD show a greater benefit from CBT five years after treatment completion. Participants were 84 men and 87 women with a previous diagnosis of OCD who had completed CBT five years earlier. QoL was assessed using the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL). Symptom severity at the end of therapy was assessed using the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Men reported significantly lower QoL compared to women, and this difference remained significant when QoL scores were adjusted for symptom severity at the end of therapy.

Therefore, in this paper, we explored whether working memory capacity mediates the efficacy of BAT regarding stress reduction in 145 individuals diagnosed with MDD. At baseline, we assessed working memory capacity using an n-back task (2/3-back) and fluid intelligence using the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT). Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) at baseline and after 14 weekly sessions of BAT. A SEM model was estimated to evaluate mediation. In our SEM model, significant stress reduction after BAT was not significantly mediated either by working memory capacity or by fluid intelligence.

However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up).

However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up).

Defensive reactivity was measured using a fear-potentiated startle reflex test. To assess QoL, participants completed the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36). Startle blink reflex potentiation deficits during aversive picture viewing were common in the sample (62.3%). Blink reflex potentiation was negatively and significantly associated with QoL. In sum, these findings provide clear evidence that deficits in defensive reactivity are linked to poor QoL in ASPD.","text/13a.html_decision1_read",19,2926,20,3760,5,6,3442,5,6,2001,14,5492,13,2450,1,1922,37882,24689,"2024-11-14_12:00.36.654"

Behavioral activation (BA), as a third-wave behavioral therapy, is consistently found to be an efficacious treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to its role in treating MDD, BA may be beneficial in terms of alleviating anxiety in GAD. However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were not significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, we did not find significant differences in treatment efficacy between younger and older patients. Our findings suggest that BA might not always be an efficacious treatment option in GAD. Moreover, in contrast to depression, younger people do not show stronger effects of BA in GAD.","text/12b.html_decision1_read",29,9572,29,7510,4,5,12167,4,5,2628,29,12425,30,1931,1,16807,64480,92230,"2024-01-30_14:30.43.827"

However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up).

GAD-7 scores were significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, the effect of BA on symptom reduction was significantly associated with age, with younger patients benefiting more from BA than older patients.

Behavioral activation (BA), as a third-wave behavioral therapy, is consistently found to be an efficacious treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to its role in treating MDD, BA may be beneficial in terms of alleviating anxiety in GAD. However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, the effect of BA on symptom reduction was significantly associated with age, with younger patients benefiting more from BA than older patients. Our findings suggest that BA is also relevant for GAD.

Behavioral activation (BA), as a third-wave behavioral therapy, is consistently found to be an efficacious treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to its role in treating MDD, BA may be beneficial in terms of alleviating anxiety in GAD. However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were not significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, we did not find significant differences in treatment efficacy between younger and older patients. Our findings suggest that BA might not always be an efficacious treatment option in GAD.
