Eighty-nine (54%) individuals experienced improvement gains and 39 (24%) experienced a deterioration of anxiety. In line with our hypothesis, patients in the MT group experienced stronger improvements than those in the ACT group. Rates of symptom change were highest between baseline and first follow-up. Neither individuals in the MT group nor those in the ACT group showed a pronounced further symptom reduction between 12- and 18-month follow-up. The results highlight the beneficial effect of both MT and ACT in the treatment of GAD, but also suggest that MT might lead to more pronounced symptom improvement.","text/15a.html_decision1",59,6126,4,5,9747,39,3962,1,33041,105762,1965

However, in other anxiety disorders, group-based approaches are known to be more effective. Studies on personality risk factors in GAD found that the disorder is strongly associated with low extraversion. Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion. A total of 134 individuals diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-5 criteria took part in our randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to group-based psychodynamic therapy, individual psychodynamic therapy, or a wait list control group. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) were completed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals. The findings suggest that patients with low extraversion benefit less from group-based psychodynamic therapy.","text/8a.html_decision1",71,4138,4,5,4189,69,14642,0,1207,56218,NA

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81).

As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals.

However, in other anxiety disorders, group-based approaches are known to be more effective. Studies on personality risk factors in GAD found that the disorder is strongly associated with low extraversion. Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion. A total of 134 individuals diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-5 criteria took part in our randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to group-based psychodynamic therapy, individual psychodynamic therapy, or a wait list control group. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) were completed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals. The findings suggest that patients with low extraversion benefit less from group-based psychodynamic therapy.","text/8a.html_decision1",61,7726,4,5,2783,61,2745,0,1780,93380,NA

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety symptoms at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. Eighty-nine (54%) individuals experienced improvement gains and 39 (24%) experienced a deterioration of anxiety. In line with our hypothesis, patients in the MT group experienced stronger improvements than those in the ACT group. Rates of symptom change were highest between baseline and first follow-up. Neither individuals in the MT group nor those in the ACT group showed a pronounced further symptom reduction between 12- and 18-month follow-up. The results highlight the beneficial effect of both MT and ACT in the treatment of GAD, but also suggest that MT might lead to more pronounced symptom improvement.","text/15a.html_decision1",70,2574,5,6,4163,70,4755,0,6049,68960,NA

As trauma exposure may be involved in the development of BPD, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) might be a beneficial treatment option for patients with the disorder. To examine whether TF-CBT leads to greater increases in QoL compared to standard care in patients with BPD, we conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone with TF-CBT. Eighty-nine adult outpatients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder according to the DSM-5 criteria received either CBT (n = 46) or TF-CBT (n = 43). Patients completed self-report measures before randomization and again two months later. Compared with CBT participants, those who underwent TF-CBT experienced greater improvements in several domains of QoL, including general functioning, physical health, psychological distress, interpersonal problems, and overall QoL. Our results suggest that, confirming our initial hypothesis, TF-CBT represents a promising treatment option in terms of improving QoL in individuals with borderline personality disorder exceeding standard care.","text/3a.html_decision1",90,2565,5,6,2134,94,2612,0,15410,70690,NA

However, in other anxiety disorders, group-based approaches are known to be more effective. Studies on personality risk factors in GAD found that the disorder is strongly associated with low extraversion. Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion. A total of 134 individuals diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-5 criteria took part in our randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to group-based psychodynamic therapy, individual psychodynamic therapy, or a wait list control group. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) were completed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals.

Despite skepticism from many practitioners, telepsychotherapy (TPT) represents an efficacious alternative to regular face-to-face psychotherapy (FTF-PT) for various mental disorders. Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from TPT compared to FTF-PT. A possible mechanism for this might be that in TPT, social cues are experienced as less threatening compared to FTF-PT.","text/6b.html_decision1",90,6331,5,6,2301,90,2331,1,1344,116600,3246

In a randomized controlled trial, we investigated whether individuals with PA show a greater symptom reduction after cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) compared to individuals with AwFS, who might have more difficulties in extinction learning during treatment. Eighty-three participants with AwFs and 94 with PA were randomly assigned to either a 12-week CBT condition (n=91) or a waiting list condition (n=86). Symptom severity was prospectively followed up after 12 weeks using the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS). Repeated measures ANOVA models were estimated.

Studies on personality risk factors in GAD found that the disorder is strongly associated with low extraversion. Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion. A total of 134 individuals diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-5 criteria took part in our randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to group-based psychodynamic therapy, individual psychodynamic therapy, or a wait list control group. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) were completed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals.

57,2,12,6,0,"hypothesis-inconsistent","Telepsychotherapy in Social Anxiety Disorder","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects approximately 2% of adults worldwide, most commonly during adolescence. Despite skepticism from many practitioners, telepsychotherapy (TPT) represents an efficacious alternative to regular face-to-face psychotherapy (FTF-PT) for various mental disorders. Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from TPT compared to FTF-PT. A possible mechanism for this might be that in TPT, social cues are experienced as less threatening compared to FTF-PT.","text/6b.html_decision1",70,5031,4,5,2695,69,1743,0,2566,38069,NA

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81).

To our knowledge, no empirical research has compared hindsight bias in MDD and GAD. Based on the current literature, we hypothesized that hindsight bias would be as pronounced in MDD as in GAD. To investigate this, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 169 participants (84 MDD/ 85 GAD). Hindsight bias was operationalized using both the memory and the hypothetical design. Contrary to our hypothesis, hindsight bias in both the memory and the hypothetical design was more pronounced in MDD patients than in GAD patients. The results indicate that hindsight bias is stronger in MDD than in GAD.","text/9b.html_decision1",53,2162,4,5,4717,54,2589,0,1088,44385,NA
78,13,80,1,1,"hypothesis-consistent","Delayed Diagnosis of Antisocial PD in Rural Areas","Due to the lack of mental health professionals in many rural areas in the US, residence in a rural area is associated with a delayed diagnosis of mental health conditions. Surprisingly, recent studies did not find this association for individuals with personality disorders. However, given that individuals with antisocial personality disorder (APD) are especially unlikely to seek help, we predicted that those living in rural areas would receive a delayed diagnosis. We conducted a survey study with 183 individuals suffering from APD (N = 64 rural, N = 58 suburban, N = 61 urban areas). Residents of rural areas were older at the time of diagnosis (M = 31.2 years, SD = 5.3) compared to residents of suburban areas (M = 28.1, SD = 5.1) and urban areas (M = 28.5, SD = 4.9), indicating that diagnosis for individuals with APD might be delayed in rural areas in the US.","text/1a.html_decision1",43,2490,3,4,2078,41,1797,0,1362,54021,NA
78,14,86,15,0,"hypothesis-inconsistent","Metacognitive Training and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in GAD","The purpose of this study was to examine symptom change in a randomized controlled trial of metacognitive training (MT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Based on recent meta-analytic findings on GAD, we expected to observe greater symptom reductions in the MT group compared to the ACT group. N = 164 individuals with GAD were randomly assigned to MT (n = 80) or ACT (n = 84). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety symptoms at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. Eighty-nine (54%) individuals experienced improvement gains and 39 (24%) experienced a deterioration of anxiety. Contrary to our hypothesis, patients in the ACT group experienced stronger improvements than those in the MT group. Rates of symptom change were highest between baseline and first follow-up. Neither individuals in the MT group nor those in the ACT group showed a pronounced further symptom reduction between 12- and 18-month follow-up. The results highlight the beneficial effect of both MT and ACT in the treatment of GAD, but also suggest that ACT might lead to more pronounced symptom improvement.","text/15b.html_decision1",54,2698,2,3,1688,47,1874,1,1977,60020,25187
78,15,93,7,1,"hypothesis-consistent","Systemic Psychotherapy in OCD","The involvement of caregivers (parents and partners) in systemic psychotherapy (SPT) has gained attention in the mental health literature. Most of the evidence on beneficial treatment effects of systemic involvement comes from studies on affective disorders, while evidence regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is lacking. In this randomized controlled study, we hypothesized that SPT is as efficacious as psychodynamic therapy in terms of improving symptom burden in OCD.Â  A total of 147 participants were randomized either to SPT (n = 49), psychodynamic therapy (n = 49), or a wait list condition (n = 49). Symptom burden of OCD was assessed twice at 6-month intervals using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Participants in both the psychodynamic and the SPT condition showed decreases in their symptom burden scores over time. As predicted, using an equivalency test, at 6-month follow-up, there were no differences between the two groups regarding symptom burden. Symptom burden scores for the wait list condition remained unchanged. The findings suggest that SPT is as efficacious as psychodynamic therapy in terms of improving symptom burden in OCD.","text/7a.html_decision1",69,2841,5,6,2539,70,1903,0,868,64519,NA
78,16,99,16,0,"hypothesis-inconsistent","Subclinical Social anxiety and Group Therapy Outcomes","Randomized controlled trials have documented the efficacy of transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral group therapy (TCB-GT). However, little is known about the role of subclinical social anxiety in TCB-GT, which is associated with worse outcomes in other group therapy settings. We hypothesized that individuals with higher social anxiety would experience less pronounced improvements during group therapy. In this multi-center study, 181 patients with panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder took part in 20 weekly sessions of TCB-GT. The exclusion criterion was fulfillment of all diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder. All participants completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) at pre-treatment baseline and diagnosis-specific symptom measures at baseline, 10-week follow-up and 20-week follow-up. Strong symptom improvements were observed at both follow-ups, with the exception of the bipolar disorder subgroup at the first follow-up. Inconsistent with our expectation, individuals with lower social anxiety experienced less pronounced improvements during group therapy. The results demonstrate that individuals with high subclinical social anxiety benefit more from TCB-GT compared to individuals with low social anxiety.","text/16b.html_decision1",75,1962,4,5,1695,73,1844,0,778,71967,NA
