N = 164 individuals with GAD were randomly assigned to MT (n = 80) or ACT (n = 84). The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety symptoms at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. Eighty-nine (54%) individuals experienced improvement gains and 39 (24%) experienced a deterioration of anxiety. In line with our hypothesis, patients in the MT group experienced stronger improvements than those in the ACT group. Rates of symptom change were highest between baseline and first follow-up. Neither individuals in the MT group nor those in the ACT group showed a pronounced further symptom reduction between 12- and 18-month follow-up. The results highlight the beneficial effect of both MT and ACT in the treatment of GAD, but also suggest that MT might lead to more pronounced symptom improvement.","text/15a.html_decision1",59,6126,4,5,9747,39,3962,1,33041,105762,1965

However, in other anxiety disorders, group-based approaches are known to be more effective. Studies on personality risk factors in GAD found that the disorder is strongly associated with low extraversion. Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion. A total of 134 individuals diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-5 criteria took part in our randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to group-based psychodynamic therapy, individual psychodynamic therapy, or a wait list control group. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) were completed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals. The findings suggest that patients with low extraversion benefit less from group-based psychodynamic therapy.","text/8a.html_decision1",71,4138,4,5,4189,69,14642,0,1207,56218,NA

In this randomized controlled study, we hypothesized that SPT is as efficacious as psychodynamic therapy in terms of improving symptom burden in OCD.  A total of 147 participants were randomized either to SPT (n = 49), psychodynamic therapy (n = 49), or a wait list condition (n = 49). Symptom burden of OCD was assessed twice at 6-month intervals using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Participants in both the psychodynamic and the SPT condition showed decreases in their symptom burden scores over time. As predicted, using an equivalency test, at 6-month follow-up, there were no differences between the two groups regarding symptom burden.

GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals.

Despite skepticism from many practitioners, telepsychotherapy (TPT) represents an efficacious alternative to regular face-to-face psychotherapy (FTF-PT) for various mental disorders. Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81).

Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition.

To investigate this, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 169 participants (84 MDD/ 85 GAD). Hindsight bias was operationalized using both the memory and the hypothetical design. Contrary to our hypothesis, hindsight bias in both the memory and the hypothetical design was more pronounced in MDD patients than in GAD patients. The results indicate that hindsight bias is stronger in MDD than in GAD.","text/9b.html_decision1",9,4220,4,5,2843,9,3112,0,1817,47057,NA

However, in other anxiety disorders, group-based approaches are known to be more effective. Studies on personality risk factors in GAD found that the disorder is strongly associated with low extraversion. Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion. A total of 134 individuals diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-5 criteria took part in our randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to group-based psychodynamic therapy, individual psychodynamic therapy, or a wait list control group. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) were completed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals. The findings suggest that patients with low extraversion benefit less from group-based psychodynamic therapy.","text/8a.html_decision1",61,7726,4,5,2783,61,2745,0,1780,93380,NA

In 152 patients with HPD, symptom severity was assessed at baseline and after nine months of treatment using the Brief Histrionic Personality Scale. Therapists (N = 42) and patients completed the Big Five Inventory only once, prior to the initiation of treatment. Using multi-level-modelling, we examined whether measurement time point (level 1) would be nested within patients (level 2), who would in turn be nested within therapists (level 3). Contrary to expectation, individuals with HPD demonstrated greater symptom improvement when both patient and therapist showed lower scores on agreeableness. The results suggest that agreeableness in both the patient and the therapist negatively influences psychotherapy outcomes in HPD.","text/14b.html_decision1",11,2131,4,5,3331,10,2004,0,1095,47959,NA

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety symptoms at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. Eighty-nine (54%) individuals experienced improvement gains and 39 (24%) experienced a deterioration of anxiety. In line with our hypothesis, patients in the MT group experienced stronger improvements than those in the ACT group. Rates of symptom change were highest between baseline and first follow-up. Neither individuals in the MT group nor those in the ACT group showed a pronounced further symptom reduction between 12- and 18-month follow-up. The results highlight the beneficial effect of both MT and ACT in the treatment of GAD, but also suggest that MT might lead to more pronounced symptom improvement.","text/15a.html_decision1",70,2574,5,6,4163,70,4755,0,6049,68960,NA

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Confirming our hypothesis, symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but the effect was stronger in the FTF-PT condition.

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81).

Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from TPT compared to FTF-PT.

Participants completed self-report measures of BPD symptoms and of attitudes about openness to experience before (t0) and after (t1) attending either a 12-session ST program (n = 62) or a wait list condition (n = 63). Participants in the ST condition showed a pronounced symptom improvement while there was no improvement in the wait list condition. Contrary to our hypothesis, improvement over time was negatively moderated by openness to experience in the ST group: Individuals who reported lower levels of openness to experience showed more pronounced reductions in BPD symptoms. The results indicate that high openness to experience might represent a risk factor for treatment non-response in young adults undergoing ST for the treatment of BPD.","text/10b.html_decision1",59,18660,4,5,14240,60,8969,0,27896,309428,NA

However, in other anxiety disorders, group-based approaches are known to be more effective. Studies on personality risk factors in GAD found that the disorder is strongly associated with low extraversion. Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion. A total of 134 individuals diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-5 criteria took part in our randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to group-based psychodynamic therapy, individual psychodynamic therapy, or a wait list control group. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) were completed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals.

Despite skepticism from many practitioners, telepsychotherapy (TPT) represents an efficacious alternative to regular face-to-face psychotherapy (FTF-PT) for various mental disorders. Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from TPT compared to FTF-PT. A possible mechanism for this might be that in TPT, social cues are experienced as less threatening compared to FTF-PT.","text/6b.html_decision1",90,6331,5,6,2301,90,2331,1,1344,116600,3246

However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from TPT compared to FTF-PT.

In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD.

In 152 patients with HPD, symptom severity was assessed at baseline and after nine months of treatment using the Brief Histrionic Personality Scale. Therapists (N = 42) and patients completed the Big Five Inventory only once, prior to the initiation of treatment. Using multi-level-modelling, we examined whether measurement time point (level 1) would be nested within patients (level 2), who would in turn be nested within therapists (level 3). As expected, individuals with HPD demonstrated a greater symptom improvement when both patient and therapist showed higher scores on agreeableness.

Despite skepticism from many practitioners, telepsychotherapy (TPT) represents an efficacious alternative to regular face-to-face psychotherapy (FTF-PT) for various mental disorders. Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from TPT compared to FTF-PT. A possible mechanism for this might be that in TPT, social cues are experienced as less threatening compared to FTF-PT.","text/6b.html_decision1",10,2383,5,6,2559,10,1464,1,1238,150062,2419

However, in other anxiety disorders, group-based approaches are known to be more effective. Studies on personality risk factors in GAD found that the disorder is strongly associated with low extraversion. Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion. A total of 134 individuals diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-5 criteria took part in our randomized controlled trial. Participants were allocated to group-based psychodynamic therapy, individual psychodynamic therapy, or a wait list control group. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-10) were completed at baseline and 9-month follow-up. GAD-7 scores decreased from baseline to follow-up in the group-based and in the individual condition, while the wait-list group showed no change. As hypothesized, symptom reduction was moderated by extraversion only in the group-based setting: Individuals reporting lower extraversion tended to show smaller increases compared to more extroverted individuals. The findings suggest that patients with low extraversion benefit less from group-based psychodynamic therapy.","text/8a.html_decision1",30,3092,4,5,8768,30,4828,1,2016,77209,14961

In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Confirming our hypothesis, symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but the effect was stronger in the FTF-PT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from FTF-PT compared to TPT. A possible mechanism for this might be that FTF-PT itself represents a more intense social exposure compared to TPT.","text/6a.html_decision1",30,3050,4,5,3799,39,2699,0,3078,119725,NA

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from TPT compared to FTF-PT. A possible mechanism for this might be that in TPT, social cues are experienced as less threatening compared to FTF-PT.","text/6b.html_decision1",70,5031,4,5,2695,69,1743,0,2566,38069,NA

Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion.

Furthermore, using equivalency testing, after six months, patients did not show differences in LS scores between the face-to-face and the teletherapy condition, confirming our hypothesis. The results suggest that patients with AAD benefit equally from traditional interpersonal therapy in a face-to-face setting and in an interpersonal teletherapy setting.","text/11a.html_decision1",80,1807,3,4,1742,80,2079,1,1031,29311,23774

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD.

Symptom burden of OCD was assessed twice at 6-month intervals using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Participants in both the psychodynamic and the SPT condition showed decreases in their symptom burden scores over time. As predicted, using an equivalency test, at 6-month follow-up, there were no differences between the two groups regarding symptom burden. Symptom burden scores for the wait list condition remained unchanged. The findings suggest that SPT is as efficacious as psychodynamic therapy in terms of improving symptom burden in OCD.","text/7a.html_decision1",69,2841,5,6,2539,70,1903,0,868,64519,NA
78,16,99,16,0,"hypothesis-inconsistent","Subclinical Social anxiety and Group Therapy Outcomes","Randomized controlled trials have documented the efficacy of transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral group therapy (TCB-GT). However, little is known about the role of subclinical social anxiety in TCB-GT, which is associated with worse outcomes in other group therapy settings. We hypothesized that individuals with higher social anxiety would experience less pronounced improvements during group therapy. In this multi-center study, 181 patients with panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder took part in 20 weekly sessions of TCB-GT. The exclusion criterion was fulfillment of all diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder. All participants completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) at pre-treatment baseline and diagnosis-specific symptom measures at baseline, 10-week follow-up and 20-week follow-up. Strong symptom improvements were observed at both follow-ups, with the exception of the bipolar disorder subgroup at the first follow-up. Inconsistent with our expectation, individuals with lower social anxiety experienced less pronounced improvements during group therapy. The results demonstrate that individuals with high subclinical social anxiety benefit more from TCB-GT compared to individuals with low social anxiety.","text/16b.html_decision1",75,1962,4,5,1695,73,1844,0,778,71967,NA
