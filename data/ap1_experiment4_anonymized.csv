Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but contrary to our hypothesis, the effect was stronger in the TPT condition.

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD.

Despite skepticism from many practitioners, telepsychotherapy (TPT) represents an efficacious alternative to regular face-to-face psychotherapy (FTF-PT) for various mental disorders. Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81). SAD symptom severity was evaluated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Confirming our hypothesis, symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but the effect was stronger in the FTF-PT condition. These results suggest that individuals with SAD benefit more from FTF-PT compared to TPT. A possible mechanism for this might be that FTF-PT itself represents a more intense social exposure compared to TPT.","text/6a.html_decision1_read",20,6616,9,3219,5,6,1607,5,6,1311,19,2313,9,2305,0,2110,30566,NA

In the present study, we examined whether individuals with HPD experience greater symptom improvements in the case of higher levels of agreeableness in both themselves and in their therapist. In 152 patients with HPD, symptom severity was assessed at baseline and after nine months of treatment using the Brief Histrionic Personality Scale. Therapists (N = 42) and patients completed the Big Five Inventory only once, prior to the initiation of treatment. Using multi-level-modelling, we examined whether measurement time point (level 1) would be nested within patients (level 2), who would in turn be nested within therapists (level 3). As expected, individuals with HPD demonstrated a greater symptom improvement when both patient and therapist showed higher scores on agreeableness. The results suggest that agreeableness in both the patient and the therapist positively influences psychotherapy outcomes in HPD.","text/14a.html_decision1_read",68,2964,55,4137,4,5,7703,3,4,3930,58,3628,56,5665,0,2039,5865,NA

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD.

Thus, the present study investigated whether the efficacy of group-based psychodynamic therapy is moderated by extraversion. We hypothesized that individuals with low extraversion might benefit less from the advantageous effects of group-based psychodynamic therapy than those with higher extraversion.

In a randomized controlled trial, 153 individuals with a previous diagnosis of AAD who had been abstinent for at least six months were randomized to a teletherapy condition or a face-to-face condition. We hypothesized  that participants in the two conditions would experience equivalent increases in LS over the course of six months. LS was assessed with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) at baseline and six months later. On average, LS increased between the two measurement time points. Furthermore, using equivalency testing, after six months, patients in the face-to-face condition showed larger increases in LS scores compared to patients in the teletherapy condition. The results suggest that patients with AAD benefit more from traditional interpersonal therapy in a face-to-face setting compared to an interpersonal teletherapy setting.","text/11b.html_decision1_read",40,5967,39,3399,4,5,4199,2,3,4735,39,8167,39,5136,0,2102,28522,NA

Unfortunately, many studies examining TPT excluded patients with SAD due to their often-found deficits in adapting to new forms of social situations. However, since telepsychotherapy represents a less intense social exposure for individuals with SAD, we assumed that the favorable effects of exposure would be less intense in TPT compared to FTF-PT for patients with SAD. In an experimental design, we gathered 12-month follow-up data for 164 individuals diagnosed with SAD. Participants were randomized either to regular cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (n = 83) or to telepsychotherapy (n = 81).

Confirming our hypothesis, symptom severity declined in both conditions over time, but the effect was stronger in the FTF-PT condition.

Therapists (N = 42) and patients completed the Big Five Inventory only once, prior to the initiation of treatment. Using multi-level-modelling, we examined whether measurement time point (level 1) would be nested within patients (level 2), who would in turn be nested within therapists (level 3). Contrary to expectation, individuals with HPD demonstrated greater symptom improvement when both patient and therapist showed lower scores on agreeableness. The results suggest that agreeableness in both the patient and the therapist negatively influences psychotherapy outcomes in HPD.","text/14b.html_decision1_read",32,5586,8,3149,5,6,3744,5,6,1828,26,3996,18,2359,0,1437,71336,NA
75,13,114,3,0,"hypothesis-inconsistent","Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Borderline Personality Disorder","Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental illness associated with poor quality of life (QoL). As trauma exposure may be involved in the development of BPD, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) might be a beneficial treatment option for patients with the disorder. To examine whether TF-CBT leads to greater increases in QoL compared to standard care in patients with BPD, we conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone with TF-CBT. Eighty-nine adult outpatients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder according to the DSM-5 criteria received either CBT (n = 46) or TF-CBT (n = 43). Patients completed self-report measures before randomization and again two months later. Compared with CBT participants, those who underwent TF-CBT experienced smaller improvements in several domains of QoL, including general functioning, physical health, psychological distress, interpersonal problems, and overall QoL. Contrary to our hypothesis, our results suggest that TF-CBT is less beneficial than the standard-care CBT option in terms of improving QoL in individuals with borderline personality disorder.","text/3b.html_decision1_read",84,4305,19,2293,2,3,2132,2,3,2626,61,6395,19,3087,1,4845,85304,17156
75,14,124,2,0,"hypothesis-inconsistent","Laxative abuse in Bulimia nervosa and Prolonged Inpatient Stay","Laxative abuse (LA) in patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) is associated with greater suicidality and self-harm as compared to self-induced vomiting (SIV). Due to these unfavorable associations with LA, we assumed that patients who mainly use LA for compensatory purging would also remain in inpatient treatment for longer than BN patients who mainly use SIV. We interviewed 154 patients with BN about their compensatory behaviors following admission to an inpatient clinic for eating disorders. Of these, 102 individuals reported predominantly using SIV while 52 reported predominantly using LA. Compared to patients mainly using SIV (M = 10.5, SD = 4.1), patients primarily using LA did not stay in inpatient care for longer (M = 9.8, SD = 4.6). While there are several unfavorable associations with LA, we conclude that LA in patients with BN is not associated with prolonged inpatient stays.","text/2b.html_decision1_read",76,6439,18,2541,3,4,2506,3,4,1640,76,3998,9,2729,0,1578,92325,NA
75,15,133,13,0,"hypothesis-inconsistent","Systemic Therapy & Metacognitive Therapy in Bipolar I disorder","Recent studies suggest that systemic therapy (ST) provides beneficial effects in terms of reducing symptoms and recurrence rates in mood disorders, which exceed the effects of other therapies such as metacognitive therapy (MT). However, to date, no study has compared the effectiveness of ST and MT in patients with bipolar I disorder (BID). To fill this gap, in a randomized controlled trial, we compared the effectiveness of MT and ST regarding symptom reduction in 163 patients with BID. We hypothesized that symptom reduction would be more pronounced in the ST group than in the MT group. Participants completed symptom severity measures at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. While symptoms decreased in both conditions, the MT group showed a stronger symptom reduction than the ST group. The results provide evidence that ST represents an efficacious treatment option for BID, but that MT is superior.","text/13b.html_decision1_read",83,6677,20,3461,5,6,13595,5,6,1517,83,3979,91,4163,0,1454,156639,NA
75,16,142,7,1,"hypothesis-consistent","Systemic Psychotherapy in OCD","The involvement of caregivers (parents and partners) in systemic psychotherapy (SPT) has gained attention in the mental health literature. Most of the evidence on beneficial treatment effects of systemic involvement comes from studies on affective disorders, while evidence regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is lacking. In this randomized controlled study, we hypothesized that SPT is as efficacious as psychodynamic therapy in terms of improving symptom burden in OCD.  A total of 147 participants were randomized either to SPT (n = 49), psychodynamic therapy (n = 49), or a wait list condition (n = 49). Symptom burden of OCD was assessed twice at 6-month intervals using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Participants in both the psychodynamic and the SPT condition showed decreases in their symptom burden scores over time. As predicted, using an equivalency test, at 6-month follow-up, there were no differences between the two groups regarding symptom burden. Symptom burden scores for the wait list condition remained unchanged. The findings suggest that SPT is as efficacious as psychodynamic therapy in terms of improving symptom burden in OCD.","text/7a.html_decision1_read",66,5503,27,2498,3,4,2939,3,4,1150,61,3986,19,3085,0,1680,83551,NA
