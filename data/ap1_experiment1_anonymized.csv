Residual symptoms after treatment and dropout rates are especially high in young adults. Evidence from other personality disorders suggests that in this age group, the therapist’s experience is negatively associated with treatment outcome. Thus, in the present study, we examined whether young adults (18-30 years) with BPD treated by more experienced therapists were more likely (1) to report elevated symptoms at post-treatment and (2) to drop out of therapy. In total, 145 individuals diagnosed with BPD underwent a standardized and manualized 18-week cognitive behavior therapy intervention administered by 53 therapists (therapist experience: M=21.4; SD=7.4). Symptom severity was assessed using the Borderline Symptom List 23 (BSL-23) at baseline and after treatment. Linear and logistic multilevel models were fitted to account for the nested structure of the data. Twenty-one individuals dropped out during therapy. Young adults with BPD treated by more experienced therapists were not significantly more likely to report elevated symptoms at post-treatment or to drop out. The results indicate that young individuals with BPD do not benefit more from therapy with less experienced psychotherapists, either in terms of symptom reduction or treatment dropout.","text/15b.html_decision1",92,19519,5,6,9735,60,3495,0,10277,12184,NA

However, several studies have documented high dropout rates. A recent study found that low high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), a reliable physiological indicator of parasympathetic activation, predicted dropout from exposure-focused therapy in patients with agoraphobia. Therefore, we investigated whether low pre-treatment HF-HRV predicts therapy dropout in individuals with arachnophobia. A total of 146 patients with arachnophobia underwent a standardized and manualized 12-week treatment focusing on exposure in vivo. Logistic regression models were fitted. Forty-two patients dropped out during treatment. HF-HRV was not significantly associated with dropout from exposure-focused treatment.

Therefore, in this paper, we explored whether working memory capacity mediates the efficacy of BAT regarding stress reduction in 145 individuals diagnosed with MDD. At baseline, we assessed working memory capacity using an n-back task (2/3-back) and fluid intelligence using the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT). Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) at baseline and after 14 weekly sessions of BAT. A SEM model was estimated to evaluate mediation. In our SEM model, significant stress reduction after BAT was not significantly mediated either by working memory capacity or by fluid intelligence. The findings indicate that the efficacy of BAT regarding stress reduction is not mediated by working memory capacity or by other aspects of fluid intelligence, potentially ruling out a shared functional area in the hypothalamus.","text/9b.html_decision1",71,4416,5,6,2530,81,2177,0,2047,5005,NA

This observational study examined whether women with OCD show a greater benefit from CBT five years after treatment completion. Participants were 84 men and 87 women with a previous diagnosis of OCD who had completed CBT five years earlier. QoL was assessed using the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL). Symptom severity at the end of therapy was assessed using the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Men did not differ significantly in QoL compared to women, and there was no significant difference when QoL scores were adjusted for symptom severity at the end of therapy.

Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) at baseline and after 14 weekly sessions of BAT. A SEM model was estimated to evaluate mediation. In our SEM model, significant stress reduction after BAT was significantly mediated by working memory capacity but not by fluid intelligence. The findings demonstrate that the efficacy of BAT regarding stress reduction is mediated by working memory capacity but not by other aspects of fluid intelligence, possibly indicating a shared functional area between stress regulation and working memory.","text/9a.html_decision1",70,2783,2,3,2535,59,2734,1,1662,66698,43209

However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up).

However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, the effect of BA on symptom reduction was significantly associated with age, with younger patients benefiting more from BA than older patients.

Six months after hospital discharge, participants completed a self-report questionnaire for PDDS using the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES). 20.1% of the women reported ADS above the cut-off (BDI score ≥ 18) and 7.4% reported having dissociative experiences in the six months after birth (DES score ≥ 20). ADS scores did not significantly predict PDDS, as higher ADS scores did not indicate higher PDDS scores. Further research is necessary to investigate why, contrary to findings in Bolivian mothers, ADS scores showed no correlation with PDDS scores in American mothers.","text/2b.html_decision1",19,3089,5,6,3813,18,3243,0,4374,54600,NA

Behavioral activation (BA), as a third-wave behavioral therapy, is consistently found to be an efficacious treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to its role in treating MDD, BA may be beneficial in terms of alleviating anxiety in GAD. However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were not significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, we did not find significant differences in treatment efficacy between younger and older patients.

Therefore, in this paper, we explored whether working memory capacity mediates the efficacy of BAT regarding stress reduction in 145 individuals diagnosed with MDD. At baseline, we assessed working memory capacity using an n-back task (2/3-back) and fluid intelligence using the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT).

However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7).

In addition to its role in treating MDD, BA may be beneficial in terms of alleviating anxiety in GAD. However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were not significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, we did not find significant differences in treatment efficacy between younger and older patients. Our findings suggest that BA might not always be an efficacious treatment option in GAD. Moreover, in contrast to depression, younger people do not show stronger effects of BA in GAD.","text/12b.html_decision1",50,3492,2,3,2054,58,4189,0,1267,1155,NA

In total, 145 individuals diagnosed with BPD underwent a standardized and manualized 18-week cognitive behavior therapy intervention administered by 53 therapists (therapist experience: M=21.4; SD=7.4). Symptom severity was assessed using the Borderline Symptom List 23 (BSL-23) at baseline and after treatment.

Participants were 84 men and 87 women with a previous diagnosis of OCD who had completed CBT five years earlier. QoL was assessed using the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL). Symptom severity at the end of therapy was assessed using the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Men did not differ significantly in QoL compared to women, and there was no significant difference when QoL scores were adjusted for symptom severity at the end of therapy. No differences were identified for any facet of QoL. The findings suggest that women with OCD do not benefit more from CBT in terms of long-term QoL.","text/5b.html_decision1",19,3104,0,1,4047,9,4506,1,1919,48017,5241

However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up).

Symptom severity was assessed using the Borderline Symptom List 23 (BSL-23) at baseline and after treatment. Linear and logistic multilevel models were fitted to account for the nested structure of the data. Twenty-one individuals dropped out during therapy. Young adults with BPD treated by more experienced therapists were not significantly more likely to report elevated symptoms at post-treatment or to drop out. The results indicate that young individuals with BPD do not benefit more from therapy with less experienced psychotherapists, either in terms of symptom reduction or treatment dropout.","text/15b.html_decision1",0,6143,5,6,4030,0,6026,0,1733,82976,NA

In total, 145 individuals diagnosed with BPD underwent a standardized and manualized 18-week cognitive behavior therapy intervention administered by 53 therapists (therapist experience: M=21.4; SD=7.4).

Therefore, in this paper, we explored whether working memory capacity mediates the efficacy of BAT regarding stress reduction in 145 individuals diagnosed with MDD. At baseline, we assessed working memory capacity using an n-back task (2/3-back) and fluid intelligence using the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFIT). Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) at baseline and after 14 weekly sessions of BAT. A SEM model was estimated to evaluate mediation. In our SEM model, significant stress reduction after BAT was significantly mediated by working memory capacity but not by fluid intelligence. The findings demonstrate that the efficacy of BAT regarding stress reduction is mediated by working memory capacity but not by other aspects of fluid intelligence, possibly indicating a shared functional area between stress regulation and working memory.","text/9a.html_decision1",37,2214,4,5,2039,37,3399,0,830,53684,NA

67,3,19,12,1,"significant","Efficacy of Behavioral Activation Depending on Age in Generalized Anxiety Disorder","Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses worldwide. Behavioral activation (BA), as a third-wave behavioral therapy, is consistently found to be an efficacious treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to its role in treating MDD, BA may be beneficial in terms of alleviating anxiety in GAD. However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, the effect of BA on symptom reduction was significantly associated with age, with younger patients benefiting more from BA than older patients. Our findings suggest that BA is also relevant for GAD. Moreover, comparable to depression, younger people show stronger effects of BA in GAD.","text/12a.html_decision1",50,3059,4,5,2317,39,1480,1,3934,50621,9085

In our SEM model, significant stress reduction after BAT was significantly mediated by working memory capacity but not by fluid intelligence. The findings demonstrate that the efficacy of BAT regarding stress reduction is mediated by working memory capacity but not by other aspects of fluid intelligence, possibly indicating a shared functional area between stress regulation and working memory.","text/9a.html_decision1",28,1637,2,3,3357,29,2846,1,1506,39785,2257

A total of 129 women diagnosed with BN received group MBCT. The Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS) was applied pre- and post-intervention and an ANOVA was conducted. A significant interaction effect emerged, indicating an improvement in emotion regulation over time, especially in patients reporting lower emotion regulation skills at baseline. Mindfulness-based interventions might be useful to tackle aspects of dysregulation in eating disorders.","text/1a.html_decision1",63,3031,2,3,2247,69,6854,1,1414,42568,55396

In total, 145 individuals diagnosed with BPD underwent a standardized and manualized 18-week cognitive behavior therapy intervention administered by 53 therapists (therapist experience: M=21.4; SD=7.4).

Behavioral activation (BA), as a third-wave behavioral therapy, is consistently found to be an efficacious treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to its role in treating MDD, BA may be beneficial in terms of alleviating anxiety in GAD. However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, the effect of BA on symptom reduction was significantly associated with age, with younger patients benefiting more from BA than older patients.

Behavioral activation (BA), as a third-wave behavioral therapy, is consistently found to be an efficacious treatment option for major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to its role in treating MDD, BA may be beneficial in terms of alleviating anxiety in GAD. However, little is known about whether BA reduces anxiety across the lifespan, as BA shows a high age-sensitive efficacy in patients with MDD, with younger patients benefiting more from BA compared to older patients. Therefore, the present study analyzed whether age is associated with the efficacy of BA regarding anxiety reduction. The sample comprised 163 individuals with GAD, who participated at two measurement time points (baseline and 6-month follow-up). The mean age was 39.3 years (SD = 9.7) and age was normally distributed. GAD symptom severity was examined using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). GAD-7 scores were significantly reduced at follow-up. Furthermore, the effect of BA on symptom reduction was significantly associated with age, with younger patients benefiting more from BA than older patients. Our findings suggest that BA is also relevant for GAD. Moreover, comparable to depression, younger people show stronger effects of BA in GAD.","text/12a.html_decision1",63,1771,2,3,3244,61,2195,0,848,911,NA

Residual symptoms after treatment and dropout rates are especially high in young adults. Evidence from other personality disorders suggests that in this age group, the therapist’s experience is negatively associated with treatment outcome. Thus, in the present study, we examined whether young adults (18-30 years) with BPD treated by more experienced therapists were more likely (1) to report elevated symptoms at post-treatment and (2) to drop out of therapy. In total, 145 individuals diagnosed with BPD underwent a standardized and manualized 18-week cognitive behavior therapy intervention administered by 53 therapists (therapist experience: M=21.4; SD=7.4). Symptom severity was assessed using the Borderline Symptom List 23 (BSL-23) at baseline and after treatment. Linear and logistic multilevel models were fitted to account for the nested structure of the data. Twenty-one individuals dropped out during therapy. Young adults with BPD treated by more experienced therapists were not significantly more likely to report elevated symptoms at post-treatment or to drop out. The results indicate that young individuals with BPD do not benefit more from therapy with less experienced psychotherapists, either in terms of symptom reduction or treatment dropout.","text/15b.html_decision1",58,1610,4,5,1719,61,1659,0,1017,1148,NA

Therefore, we investigated whether low pre-treatment HF-HRV predicts therapy dropout in individuals with arachnophobia. A total of 146 patients with arachnophobia underwent a standardized and manualized 12-week treatment focusing on exposure in vivo. Logistic regression models were fitted. Forty-two patients dropped out during treatment. HF-HRV was not significantly associated with dropout from exposure-focused treatment.

We postulated that PRS would predict heart rate within in-vivo as well as in-virtuo trials. Data were analyzed from 132 individuals diagnosed with agoraphobia who underwent either in-vivo (N = 63) or in-virtuo (N = 69) exposure. As assumed, heart rate was significantly predicted by PRS in both treatment groups.
